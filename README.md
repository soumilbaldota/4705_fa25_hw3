# 4705 Fall 2025 Homework 3
## Image Captioning with a Conditioned LSTM Generator

Homework 3 for COMS W4705 Summer 2025. 

This assignment requires you to complete an existing Jupyter notebook. The training process requires a GPU. You could use Google Colab to complete the assignment. You could alternatively use a third party cloud provider offering GPUs, such as lambdalabs.com or vast.ai. It should also be possible to complete the assignment on a mac with M1/M2/M3 chip.

Step 1: Please download the .ipynb for homework 3 from this repository. 

Step 2: Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebook to complete the assignment (includes instructions for downloading data).

Step 3 *SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS*: When you are done with the homework, make sure that you can see the output of every cell. The reason we need you to run all cells in the notebook before you share is that so we can see the output exactly as you saw it. Neural models tend to get different outputs when the models are retrained. Just in case, we want to see the outcome as you saw it before we decide whether or not we want to rerun some of your notebook cells. Then download the notebook and upload it to Courseworks. You must also upload a PDF version of your notebook (which you can create from within Jupyter using Print -> Save as PDF).
